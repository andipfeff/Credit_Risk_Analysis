# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

Using LendingClub's credit card dataset, six different machine learning models were trained and evaluated to figure out which model, if any, would be the best predictor of credit card risk. The models were built by resampling the dataset using the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn Python libraries within Jupyter Notebooks.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
